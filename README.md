# AndreasIMDBProject

This repository holds files related to a self challenged project I have undertaken working with Big Data, using datasets from IMDB: https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/. (These files are too big to put in the repository so please download them from the link if you want to look at the raw data itself)

The Purpose is to create a dashboard to analyse the popularity of movies/actors, through the use of visualisations and tables which can be filtered by attributes such as year and genre.

â€‹Additionally, this project allows me to familiarise myself with tools that might be used in a data-related job; Power BI and Apache Spark.

Apache Spark was used to explore, pre-process and transform over 2,000,000 rows of data.

Then the transformed data is then loaded into Power BI to create visualisations and a table where users can query the data
